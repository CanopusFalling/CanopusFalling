# Hello 👋

I'm Canopy, I'm disabled and queer. This github is essentially a showcase of all the projects I rarely ever finish (that's on the unmedicated ADHD.) Feel free to have a nosey around at them and let me know if you build anything based off my work, I'd love to know if you do.

## Current Projects

- [PodTally](https://podtally.com): podcast sync and sharing service because I got annoyed at not being able to share podcast reccommendations and my current listening easily.
