## Hello!

I'm currently studying at **The University of Sheffield** and constantly have a project or two in the works. If you have any cool ideas that you need any help with feel free to drop me a message. (Even if you don't need help I still love hearing about cool ideas.)

## Current Projects
### Eco Guard
This is the one I'm currently the most proud of, currently the repository is private while we get properly set up but you can check out the [site](http://theecoguard.co.uk/) to learn more about that project.
### TCTCNF
Secret project that I may or may not release depending on if it turns out to be viable with the current tools at my disposal. (ETA: At least a few months, probably more knowing me.)
### [Personal Website](https://github.com/SamTheDude/sam-antics)
I really need to make myself a proper website and just host it on github this time, the current one is a mess of whatever I thought was an interesting thing to do back in January of last year. Hosted the last one with my free Azure credits as well, good fun to play with a back end server but still cost $100 a year if I was paying myself so I shall not be doing that nonsense. If you want to see that site [here](https://github.com/SamTheDude/sam-antics) is the repository. (ETA: Probably a month, placements have already started so if I don't start soon that'll be a yikes.)
### COM1001 Team Project
Currently in the process of getting approval from all the team members and the uni to release that project out here in the public, it's currently a hidden repo so I can tidy it up in the meantime.
### [Learning Haskell](https://github.com/SamTheDude/learning-haskell)
Gotta re-learn this language, for more details on how I'm learning it see the repository [here](https://github.com/SamTheDude/learning-haskell). Also did you know some people build web servers in Haskell!?!?! Not doing that one, it sounds like actual hell, I'd take making one in ruby(sinatra) any day over that.

## Abandoned Projects
My github is full of seemingly abandoned projects and crud, some I will compact down or dispose of in future but other items are there as logs of me learning to code. 

One of the most significant being [Golf Course GPS Management System](https://github.com/SamTheDude/GolfCourseGPSManagementSystem) which was my A-level project. At the time I knew how much of a sin the code was becoming but I was never taught how to use OOP in PHP so I just floundered the whole time. Strangely I think I got marked down on my SQL for some reason? Looking back it all looks fine so I can't work that out, may have to scan in my report from home when I get the chance.

It's a shame nobody told me about git earlier or I could have my very first text based adventure games that I made in python up here.
